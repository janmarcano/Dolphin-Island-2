A game by Jan Marcano and James T.



About (Tooken from the itch.io page):
Thanks to Sora and Momo peace has returned to Dolphin Island.
After returning from the game world to reality, something happens to Sora.
The program for the peaceful Dolphin Island is rewritten by someone and the Devil King they had worked so hard to beat has revived.
The classmates that had the game cassettes are all captured by the Devil King.
Sora looks for programmers in the real world.
In Sora's stead, Aisha dives into the game world to rescue their classmates.
While coming and going between the two worlds, can they beat the Demon King and rescue their classmates?

About X version:
I changed somethings in this version, there is a .gd file with the changes made. They are minior, but I felt they were needed. However in doing so the tutorial text became broken. I don't know what it is, maybe the github version is not the same as the full release. I doubt it though.
